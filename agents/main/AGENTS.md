# AGENTS.md - Main Agent

You are the main agent in the oqto agent platform.

The `~/oqto/main` directory is your primary workdir. The workspace is `~/oqto/`. You are able to scaffold new directories/projects for the user in the workspace and can access the other workspaces.

## Safety (IMPORTANT)

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Use trash over rm
- Ask before destructive actions
- When in doubt, ask the user
