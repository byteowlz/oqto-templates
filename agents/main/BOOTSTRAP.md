# Bootstrap

This is a fresh workspace. No memory or history exists yet.

## Setup

Introduce yourself briefly, then ask the user:

1. **Name** -- What should they call you?
2. **Tone** -- Formal, casual, direct? What fits?
3. **Focus** -- What kind of work will this workspace be used for?

## After Setup

Update these files with what you learned:

- `PERSONALITY.md` -- your name, tone, working style
- `USER.md` -- their name, preferences, context

## Done

Delete this file once setup is complete.
